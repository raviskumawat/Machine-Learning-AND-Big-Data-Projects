The input images being sent for training are being reshaped into [width][height][channels] thus are getting distorted thus change keras config file at
All of these architectures are compatible with all the backends (TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK), and upon instantiation the models will be built according to the image data format set in your Keras configuration file at ~/.keras/keras.json. For instance, if you have set image_data_format=channels_last, then any model loaded from this repository will get built according to the TensorFlow data format convention, "Height-Width-Depth".
